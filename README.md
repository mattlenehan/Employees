# Build Tools & Versions Used
Android Studio 4.1.2
minSdk is 21

# Your Focus Areas
I focused on real world extensibility as if this was an app that was being added to by a team.
That means the ViewItem and ViewHolders are structured to handle future new item types. The Repository
would one day be expanded to be the source of truth for data from the webservice as well as the db.
I also wanted the UI to look nice so I made EmployeeType tiles to allow the user to quickly scan
for different types. Some key features like search, sorting, and filtering are not implemented
yet but those would've definitely been helpful too.

# Copied-in code or copied-in dependencies
I referred to code from Crew especially for setting up viewbinding and referring to which gradle library
versions we used. Also used StackOverflow.

# Tablet / phone focus?
Looks good on either

# How long you spent on the project?
~5 hours
